# GIT COMMIT

The **_commit_** command is used to save your changes to the local repository. Note that you have to explicitly tell Git which changes you want to include in a commit before running the "git commit" command. This means that a file won't be automatically included in the next commit just because it was changed.

The command should be used as git commit -m "comment"</font>
